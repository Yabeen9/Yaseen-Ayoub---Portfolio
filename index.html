								<p>I'm Yaseen Ayoub, a dedicated and highly skilled Mechanical Engineering graduate student at the Barrett Honors College of Arizona State University. With a B.S.E. in Mechanical Engineering and an expected M.S. in Mechanical Engineering by December 2024, I am driven by a passion for engineering excellence and innovation.

									My expertise spans a variety of technical areas, including SolidWorks, ANSYS, MATLAB, Python, and more. I have significant experience in product design, structural analysis, and optimization, underscored by my work on the Topology Optimization tool in ANSYS/SpaceClaim and my involvement in advanced research projects.
									
									In my professional journey, I have contributed to industry-leading organizations like Tesla, where I built a mesh model of the vehicle side door using ANSA, and PepsiCo, where I optimized the conveyor system at a manufacturing plant. My research as a Micromechanics Research Assistant and my role as a Teaching Assistant at ASU have further honed my technical and leadership skills.

									I have also excelled in project leadership roles, such as leading a team to develop a driver alert system prototype during the Devils Invent Competition, which secured funding from PayPal. My capstone project, where I served as the Test and Analysis Engineer, is a testament to my ability to manage complex engineering projects from concept to completion.
									
									Currently seeking a full-time position, I am eager to bring my skills and experience to a dynamic engineering team, where I can continue to drive innovation and deliver impactful solutions. Let's connect and explore how we can collaborate to push the boundaries of engineering and technology.</p>

								<p><p><strong>Tesla - Computer Aided Engineering (CAE) Intern</strong></p>
								<p>At Tesla, I built a mesh model of the vehicle side door using ANSA, tested dynamic load cases using LS-DYNA, analyzed post-processing results, and presented design changes. This experience honed my skills in CAE and provided me with hands-on experience in the automotive industry.</p>

								<p><strong>PepsiCo - Supply Chain and Engineering Intern</strong></p>
								<p>During my internship at PepsiCo, I optimized the conveyor system integrated with ANCRA at a manufacturing plant. I developed the Run Right Process and created a real-time Excel data tracking tool for ANCRA and its conveyor system, improving efficiency and productivity.</p>

								<p><strong>Research Assistant - Micromechanics</strong></p>
								<p>As a Research Assistant, I improved the accuracy of a uniaxial testing apparatus for micro to millimeter scale samples, researched material characterization methods, and enhanced the resolution and repeatability of force measurements.</p>

								<p><strong>Teaching Assistant - Structural Mechanics Laboratory & Principles of Mechanical Design at ASU</strong></p>
								<p>In my role as a Teaching Assistant, I performed laboratory demonstrations, assisted students in understanding mechanical design concepts, and provided real-world applications of Structural Mechanics.</p>

								<p> <p>Here are some of the key projects I have worked on throughout my academic and professional journey:</p>

                                <h3>Nonlinear FEA of Bolted Nozzle Flange used in Saturn V Rocket</h3>
                                <p>Performed stress analysis using ANSYS, modeled the nozzle flange with contact conditions, and verified FEA results with hand calculations.</p>

                                <h3>Devils Invent Competition</h3>
                                <p>Led a team to develop a prototype that alerted drowsy or distracted drivers using Arduino, Python, and SolidWorks. Secured funding from PayPal after winning second place.</p>

                                <h3>Mechanical Engineering Senior Year Capstone Project - OPTIMIC</h3>
                                <p>Worked as the Test and Analysis Engineer on a team of 6 engineers to create a multi-functional gym bar named OPTIMIC. Performed structural analysis using ANSYS Static Structural, conducted various analyses like FMEA, DFMA, DTC, reliability, and maintainability, developed and executed comprehensive testing procedures, and presented results to industry professionals and faculty.</p>

                                <h3>Topology Optimization of Beam Design</h3>
                                <p>Utilized the Topology Optimization tool paired with Static Structural in ANSYS to perform Von-Mises stress analysis, identified potential structural failure points, reduced the mass of the beam by 20%, and produced a manufacturable design using SpaceClaim-CAD software.</p>

                                <h3>Micromechanics Research</h3>
                                <p>Improved the accuracy of a uniaxial testing apparatus for micro to millimeter scale samples, researched material characterization methods, and enhanced the resolution and repeatability of force measurements.</p>
